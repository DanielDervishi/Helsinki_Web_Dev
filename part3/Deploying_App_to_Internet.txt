Same Origin Policy and CORS
    - Cross Origin Resource Sharing is a mechanism that allows sharing of resources accross origins. Ex: Images, Fonts, Scripts.
    - By default, javascript code can only communicate with a server with the same origin.
    - Origin: a 3-tuple containing protocol, port (if specified) and a host (for ex a server).
    - In the notes project, since the frontend is on port 3000 and the backend on port 3001, they do not have the same origin.
