Debugging Node Apps:
    Chrome Dev Tools:
        - Started by entering node --inspect index.js in the terminal.
        - From here, we can inspect page and click on the node icon in the top left.
        - Provides info on data present in the server
    
    MongoDB:
        - document database
        - Stores data in collections and documents
        - Collections are like an array of these documents which resemble js objects.
        - Use MongoDB Atlas
        - Steps to be followed can be found here in the MongoDB Section: https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/saving_data_to_mongo_db
        - Mongoose is an object to mongo document mapper.
        - if you made a password with special characters, it need be url encoded.
        - process.args is an array which keeps track of command line entries, where the second index is the file name and other indicies are other space-seperated entries.
        - MongoDB atlas auto creates a new database if one tries to connect to a database that does not yet exist.
        - Structure of objects does not matter in a mongo database.
    
    Schema:
        - defines shape of documents within a collection
        - creating a model is essentailly creating a constructor function for documents. Ex: mongoose.model('Note', noteSchema). Essentially, the first parameter defines the name of the collection which will be the lowercase plural "notes" and the second is the schema which defines the document structure.
        - outline for documents in a collection are defined through schema at the application level to provide structure to the data within collections.
        - schema are like the blueprints and a model is like a factory that creates the object defined by the blueprints.
    
    Creating and Saving Objects:
        - creating objects is as easy as defining a new js object like so: 
        const note = new Note({
        content: 'HTML is Easy',
        date: new Date(),
        important: false,
        })
        - Note that the argument to the Note constructor matches the structure that would be defined in the schema associated with the model.
        - To save data to the database, we just use the save method associated with the new Note object. Event handlers can be added by using the .then method.
        - After sending data, we must call mongoose.connection.close, because otherwise the application will stay connected to the url and will never finish execution.
    
    Fetching Objects From The Database:
        - it seems to fetch from a database, we need a model in place.
        - After creating a model, we can use the find method with a search parameter. More on search queries: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/
        - don't forget to close the connection

    Backend Connected to a Database:
        - It is best to save the access password to the database in a .env file (THAT IS REFERENCED IN THE .GITIGNORE FOLDER)
        - Put the dotenv import before any other code to ensure the use of environment variables within other imports.
        - You have to set the environment variable in heroku using config vars.
        - sending the response after assuring the note is sent successfully to the server is preferred.
    
    toJSON: 
        - called on each document that uses this schema when the json.stringify method is called.
        - Ex: noteSchema.set('toJSON', {
            transform: (document, returnedObject) => {
                returnedObject.id = returnedObject._id.toString()
                delete returnedObject._id
                delete returnedObject.__v
                return returnedObject
            }
        })
        - sets the 'toJSON' option of the schema to the object with the transform property set to a callback funtion that takes the document and plain object representation of the note in this case and allows us to make changes to the object before being converted into a JSON string which is only done using JSON.stringify().
        - defining transforms at the schema level keeps from applying the transform to sub-schema, which is very useful.

    Verifying Frontend and Backend Integration:
        - take a cascading approach to integrating the frontend and backend one functionality at a time.
        - make use of the rest client before using the frontend to test integration with the server to better isolate errors.
