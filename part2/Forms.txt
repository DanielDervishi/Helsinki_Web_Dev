Creating a Form:
    - Example Form:
        <form onSubmit={addNote}>
            <input />
            <button type="submit">save</button>
        </form>
        - The onSubmit attribute defines the event handler that is executed once the button is pressed.

Event Handlers:
    - Ex: const addNote = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault()
            console.log('button clicked', event.target)
            }
    - The event parameter calls the event.preventDefault() method from submitting a form which would cause the page to reload
    - Event.target is the form defined in the creating a form section

Controlled Components:
    - When we update a component, react checks the difference between the current state of the component and the new one and updates the component.
    - Since react doesn't observe the dom, we need something to detect a state change and tell react about that state change. We can use the onChange attribute for an input to tell us when there has been a change to the input and save that in some react state and re-render the component.

Conditional Operator:
    - Ex: const result = condition ? val1 : val2
    - Essentially, if a condition is true, result gets set to val1, otherwise it gets set to val2

Filtering
    - Ex: notes.filter(note => note.important === true).
