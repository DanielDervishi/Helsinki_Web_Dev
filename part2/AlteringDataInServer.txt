Rest:
    - Individual data objects are referred to as resources.
    - Each resource has a unique URL associated with it.
    - Creating a new resource for storing a note is done by making an HTTP POST request to the notes url (referring to notes app now).
    - The request is sent to the notes URL according to the REST convention that the server adheres to.

Sending data:
    - json-server requires data to be sent in JSON format.
    - when we make the request to the server, we let the server choose the id for the new note.
    - Ex post:
    axios
    .post('http://localhost:3001/notes', noteObject)
    .then(response => {
      setNotes(notes.concat(response.data))
      setNewNote('')
    })
    - The new note is returned by the backend server and we update the notes.
