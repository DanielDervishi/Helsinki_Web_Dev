To inject CSS into your HTML:
    - Between the head tags, write <link href = "styles/style.css" rel = "stylesheet">

Anatomy of CSS Ruleset:
    - Selector: HTML element name that will be styled. Ex: p
    - Declaration: Single rule about one of the properties of an HTML element. Ex: color: red;
    - Properties: Ways in which you can change html element. Ex: color
    - Property Value: Chooses the value of the property. Ex: for the property color, the property value could be red.

    Necessary Conditions For Use:
        - Rulset must be wrapped in curly brackets
        - Each declaration must use a colon to separate property from value
        - With each declaration, you must use a semicolon at the end to separate it from the next one.

Selecting Multiple Elements:
    - Simply list them and then provide the ruleset. Ex: p, li, h1 {
                                                                        color: red
                                                                }

Different Types of Selectors:
    - Element Selector: Selects all HTML elments of a specified type | Ex: p selects <p>
    - ID Selector (EACH ID VALUE ON A GIVEN HTML PAGE SHOULD BE UNIQUE): The element on the page with the specified id | #my-id selects <p id = "my-id:></p>
    - Class Selector: Elements on the page with a specified class | Ex: .my-class
    - Attribute Selector: Elements on the page with the specified attribute | Ex: img[src] selects <img src = "myimage.png"> but not img
    - Pseudo-Class Selector: Elements with a certain state | Ex: a:hover selects <a> when a mouse pointer is hovering over it

Fonts and Text:

    How to add a new font to your application:
    - To add a font to your css file, you must first add a <link> element within the <head> element of your HTML file. 
    - Ex: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet">

    Properties of fonts:
    - font-size, font-family

Box Model of HTML elements:
    
    Intuition:
        - We can think of HTML elements as boxes placed on top of one another

    Properties:
        NOTE (when setting a property like padding, 1 value sets the top, bottom, left and right padding.
        NOTE-continued 2 values set the top-bottom and then left-right padding and 4 sets all of them individuall)
        - Each box (HTML element) has the following properties
        - Padding: Space around the content
        - Border: Surrounds the padding
        - Margin: Space around the outside of the border (usually space between one box and another)
