What is a web form:
    - One of the primary forms of interaction between a user and a web page.

Relevant HTML elements:
    - <form>, <label>, <input>, <textarea>, and <button>

The <form> Element:
    - All forms start with a <form> element. Ex: <form action="/my-handling-form-page" method = "post"></form>

Important Attributes of a Form:
    - action: Defines the URL where the form's collected data should be sent when submitted.
    - method: Defines which HTTP method to use when sending the data to a URL (Ex: post and get)

<label>, <input>, and <textarea> elements
    - a <label> element should be associated with each input. This can be done by setting the for attribute of the label to the id of the input.
    - The type attribute of the input defines the type of input that the element will take on.
    - <textarea> is a non empty element, therefore it has closing tags and the default value is set within the opening and closing tags. Ex:
    <textarea>
    by default this element is filled with this text
    </textarea>
    - When using input, to set a default value, you set the value attribute to the default value you would like. Ex: <input type="text" value="by default this element is filled with this text">

<button>
    - Ex: <button type="submit">Send your message</button>

    Attributes:
        - type
            Values:
                - submit: sends the form's data to the web page defined by the action attribute on the <form> elment.
                - button: does nothing.
